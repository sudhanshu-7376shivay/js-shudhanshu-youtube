Interactivity: Enables interactive elements like dropdowns, sliders, forms, games, and animations.

Event-driven: Handles user interactions like clicks, typing, and scrolling.

Lightweight and fast: Designed to be quick to execute in the browser.

Dynamic typing: Variables can hold any data type and change types at runtime.

Object-oriented and Functional: Supports both programming paradigms.

Asynchronous capabilities: With callbacks, promises, and async/await for handling asynchronous operations.

Web development (frontend): Used in all modern websites to enhance user experience.

Web development (backend): With Node.js, JavaScript can run on servers.

Mobile apps: Through frameworks like React Native, Ionic, etc.

Desktop apps: With tools like Electron.js.

Game development, IoT, machine learning, and more.
